# portfolio1

This project is my first attempt at creating an individual portfolio website. I utilized advanced HTML, CSS, and JavaScript techniques to build it. My primary reference for this project was a YouTube tutorial, which can be found here: https://rawat221004.github.io/portfolio1/

As I continue to enhance my skills, I am currently working on a more advanced and completely different version of my portfolio. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Have a nice day!
